# Specatacles Detection
Specs Detection is the code for the of spectacles on the human face.
Automatic glasses detection on real face images is a challenging problem due to different appearance variations. Nevertheless, glasses detection on face images has not been thoroughly investigated.

During Facial Detection, glare and secondary reflections formed due to and on the spectacles results in poor detection, localization, and recognition of eye/face features.
This affect the accuracy of Facial Detection and Eye Tracking.

We propose to create Spectacle Classifier using Machine Learning which can classify if face have spectacle or not. Further this classifier can be used with other Facial Detection and Eye tracking Systems to give better results.
